# Adding various charsets to Glyphsapp

Save `groups.plist` to ~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Info/groups.plist to add a "Custom" category featuring the different charsets and ranges.

Included:
* [Latin Plus](http://www.underware.nl/latin_plus/) data by [Underware](http://www.underware.nl/) originally licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](CC-BY-SA 4.0).
* [Adobe Latin 1, 2 & 3](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/adobe-latin-charsets)
* [Latin Extended-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-A)

DISCLAIMER: All character lists have been tweaked to conform with my Glyphs workflow and Glyphs-compatible character names.
